# OpenAI Assistan(ts)

[![build status](https://img.shields.io/github/actions/workflow/status/ChuckJonas/assistan-ts/test.yml?label=CI&logo=github)](https://github.com/ChuckJonas/assistan-ts/actions/workflows/test.yml)
[![npm version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/assistan-ts.svg)](https://www.npmjs.org/package/assistan-ts)

`npm i assistan-ts`

A lightweight framework for building and running code first, type-safe "Agents".  

This library aims to make it easy to create & run assistants, without introducing heavy abstractions or departing too far from the official `openai` library. 

[Demo Video (1min)](https://youtu.be/1CNvlqAxoMM)

**Key Features:**

- Define Assistants using [`typebox`](https://github.com/sinclairzx81/typebox) schemas
- Sync changes with OpenAI
- Parse & validate arguments to tool calls
- Automatically poll `runs` for completion

> [!WARNING]
> Both this library & openai's assistants api are still in early development and is subject to change.

## Usage

### Define your Assistant


```typescript
import { Type, definition, assistant } from 'assistan-ts';

  const def = definition({
    key: "Schedul-O-Bot-3000", // 'unique' key added to metadata for linking
    model: "gpt-4",
    name: "Schedul-O-Bot-3000",
    instructions: "You help schedule meetings for E-Corp.",
    codeInterpreter: true,
    functionTools: {
      employee_directory: {
        description: "List all employees with contact and role information",
        parameters: Type.Void(),
      },
      schedule_meeting: {
        description: "Schedule a meeting with an employee",
        parameters: Type.Object({
          employee: Type.Number({
            description: "The Employee Id to schedule the meeting with",
          }),
          date: Type.String({
            description: "The date to schedule the meeting on",
            format: "date-time",
          }),
          duration: Type.Number({
            description: "The duration of the meeting in minutes",
            minimum: 15,
            maximum: 60 * 3,
          }),
        }),
      },
    },
  });
```

> [!NOTE]
> Not all `typebox` types are supported by OpenAI at this time

#### Syncing Files

You can sync files by setting the `files.resolve` property of the definition.  This allows you to sync files from the filesystem or a remote location.

```typescript
import { toFile } from "openai/uploads";
import { readFile, readdir } from "fs/promises";

const def = definition({
   //...
    retrieval: true,
    files: {
      resolve: async () => {
        const fileName = 'time-off-policy.md';
        const content = await readFile(path.join('docs', fileName));
        return [ toFile(content, filename) ];
      },
    },
});
```

Files will be compared for equality using the filename by default, but you can overrides this by setting `files.keyFn`.

### Link the Assistant to OpenAI

```typescript
const linked = await def.link(openai);
```

This will create the assistant if it doesn't exist, and update it to match the schema if there is any drift.

> [!WARNING]
>  By default, this will update the assistant to match the schema. If you want to disable this behavior, pass `{ updateMode: "skip" }` to the `link` function.


### Create an instance of your assistant

For any tools you defined, you must provide an implementation with a matching signature.

```typescript 
  const scheduleBot = assistant({
    definition: linked,
    tools: {
      employee_directory: async () => {
        return [
          {
            id: 1000,
            name: "John Chen",
            email: "ariachen@example.com",
            department: "Marketing",
            role: "Marketing Manager",
          },
          //...
        ];
      },
      schedule_meeting: async ({ employee, date, duration }) => {
        return {
          status: "success",
          meeting_id: "123",
        };
      },
    },
    toolOptions: {
        // override defaults
    }
  });
```

### Create a thread and run

```typescript
const thread = await openai.beta.threads.create({
  messages: [
    {
      role: "user",
      content: "Schedule a 45m meeting with Alana on Tuesday at 3pm",
    },
  ],
});

const { run, complete } = await scheduleBot.run.create({
  threadId: thread.id,
});

await complete({ interval: 1500 });

const messages = await openai.beta.threads.messages.list(thread.id);
```

Alternately, you can use `toolsRequired` to better control the execution of the tools:

```typescript

const { toolsRequired } = await scheduleBot.run.create({
  threadId: thread.id,
});

let toolActions = await toolsRequired();

while (toolActions) {
  //let user confirm
  if(confirm(`Continue with ${JSON.stringify(toolActions.toolCalls, null, 2)}?`)){
    toolActions = await toolActions.execute( /* you may provide overrides outputs here */ );
  }
}
```

## Running Examples

*`pg-bot` connected to coffee roasting db*

This project contains a number of [`examples`](/examples) to demonstrate the use of the library.

- `schedulo-bot-3000`: simple demo, not actually connected to anything
- `bash-bot`: Agent with full control to execute in your terminal and upload files to for the code interpreter
- `pg-bot`: Agent connected to a postgres database. Can explore schema and execute queries.

To run an example:

1. `cd examples`
1. `npm i`
1. Set the `OAI_KEY` environment variable to your OpenAI API key (`export OAI_KEY=<your key>`)
1. use `bun` to run the index file:

```bash
npx bun <example name>/index.ts
```

> [!NOTE]
> Checkout the [agentCli.ts](/examples/_lib/agentCLI.ts) to see a simple demo of how to manage the agent lifecycle.
